Naturally occurring enzymes are often poorly suited for industrial applications due to limited solubility or stability. SOLIS integrates interface-aware residue protection, evolutionary conservation analysis, structure modeling, and a multi-stage validation funnel into a unified, iterative workflow. ProteinMPNN-based sequence redesign is performed under controlled mutation constraints, followed by stringent structural, thermody- namic, and chemical filtering. Specifically, we incorporated RaSP (Rapid Stability Prediction) for high-throughput thermodynamic profiling and BioPython-based screening to eliminate chemical liability motifs. This design strategy enables large- scale exploration of enzyme variants while minimizing perturbation of the catalytic architecture. We applied SOLIS to the redesign of a prenyltransferase involved in cannabinoid biosynthesis. All selected variants exhibited high structural confidence (pLDDT > 90), native-like backbone conformations (RMSD < 2.0 Å), improved predicted thermodynamic stability, and enhanced chemical stability profiles. These results demonstrate that SOLIS provides a scalable framework for the automated prioritization of functionally viable and developable enzyme variants."

With progenitor exhausted CD8+ T cells (Tpex) emerging as a key population that sustains proliferative immune responses after immune checkpoint blockade, strategies to modulate the Tpex transcriptional program have gained attention as a potential therapeutic avenue. Transcriptome-based drug repositioning via signature reversal enables in silico exploration of such targets; however, prior studies have largely relied on rule-based manual screening. In this work, we reformulate drug repositioning for suppressing T cell exhaustion as a comparative problem between manual screening and AI-assisted candidate prediction. Using tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T-cell single-cell RNA-seq data, we defined a Tpex-specific transcriptomic signature and leveraged LINCS L1000 perturbation profiles to identify compounds predicted to reverse the signature. We then compared an expert, rule-based pipeline against an AI-assisted prioritization pipeline. Manual screening identified 62 candidates, whereas the AI-assisted pipeline prioritized 121 candidates; three drugs (MK-2206, PF-562271, and PFI- 1) were shared across both approaches, forming a conservative shortlist. These findings suggest that AI-based analysis can serve not only to automate conventional workflows but also as a hypothesis-generation “co-scientist” that expands the exploration space."

This study proposes an AI-driven framework based on physics-informed feature disentangle- ment to overcome these limitations. By integrating a specialized feature extraction algorithm with a linear regression model trained on high-fidelity PyBaMM simu- lations, we successfully isolated entangled electrochemical signatures from raw voltage profiles into deterministic physical markers. Our results demonstrate that this framework achieves a high coefficient of determination (R2) exceeding 0.9 for key parameters when physics-informed features are used. Crucially, the model’s reliability is secured by correlating AI decision-making with internal physical phenomena, such as the evolution of lithium concentration.

Conversely, emerging Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) possess the reasoning capacity to generate explanations but suffer from ""hallucinations"" when applied to the specialized, physics-constrained domain of wafer fabrication without adequate grounding. This research proposes a novel Dual-Stream Framework that bridges this gap by integrating a robust visual anchor with a physics-informed logical reasoner. Stream 1 (The Visual Verifier) utilizes a ResNet-50 architecture, fine- tuned on the massive WM-811K dataset (811,457 wafer maps), to extract high- fidelity spatial features and generate Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mappings (Grad-CAM). Stream 2 (The Logical Reasoner) employs a state-of-the- art VLM (Gemini 3 Pro) injected with Kinematic Logic—a prompt engineering paradigm that encodes specific equipment mechanics. We validated this framework against four physics-informed blind test scenarios with 18 independent runs. Experimental results demonstrate that our data scale-up strategy improved classification accuracy from 80.65% to 88.52%, while the VLM achieved a Diagnosis Accuracy of 88.9% in root cause deduction, proving its capability to map visual patterns to specific hardware failures with high semantic consistency.

From 125 collected arti- cles, 56 meeting quality criteria were converted into 146 normalized records that contained composition, space group, density, measurement temperature, and ionic conductivity, and 46 high-confidence entries were used to build the knowledge graph.

Furthermore, existing studies often prioritize classification accuracy while neglecting to verify whether the model’s decisions are based on genuine pathological features (e.g., wheezes, crackles) or spurious background noise. To address these challenges, we propose a reliability-centric framework for COPD detection utilizing a lightweight ResNet-18 architecture. We mitigate class imbalance through a dual strategy of weighted cross-entropy loss and decision threshold moving (𝜏= 0.48), which successfully boosted specificity from near-zero to 74.3% while maintaining high sensitivity. Crucially, going beyond qualitative visualization, we introduce a novel quantitative metric, the Spectral Region of Interest (ROI) Score, to mathematically validate the model's explainability. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves an accuracy of 84.6% and an average ROI Score of 0.994, proving that 99.4% of the model's attention aligns with clinically significant high-frequency spectral bands.

We use square regions of interest extracted from Akatsuki Ultraviolet 5 Imager observations on the low-latitude (5◦≤λlat ≤35◦) northern hemisphere 6 afternoon side (12:00–14:00 LT). After applying standard photometric correction 7 and preprocessing to enhance the mesoscale component, we compute scattering 8 transform coefficients and define two metrics, s21 and s22, from the first-order and 9 second-order scattering coefficients. The metric s21 quantifies the sparsity of mor- 10 phological features through the relative magnitude of the second-order coefficient 11 (S2) compared to the first-order coefficient (S1), whereas s22 characterizes the 12 dominant directional anisotropy (i.e., preferred propagation/orientation) through 13 the directional distribution of the second-order coefficient (S2,∥, S2,⊥). In the pro- 14 posed metric space, mesoscale structures exhibit a tendency to separate by spatial 15 features, demonstrating that images can be systematically explored at targeted fea- 16 tures. By tracking the metrics in time, we further identify quasi-periodic variability, 17 suggesting that the proposed framework can simultaneously trace wave-like compo- 18 nents associated with the atmospheric super-rotation and mesoscale morphological 19 evolution.

As the process advances, richer measurements become accessible, while the opportunity to rework or correct prior steps diminishes. Consequently, the central challenge is not merely accurate defect or yield prediction at individual stages, but the design of a decision-support framework that determines when and where limited inspection resources should be allocated. This paper proposes a staged decision-support pipeline spanning Stage 0 to Stage 3 that explicitly reflects this temporal structure. From Stage 0 to Stage 2A, stage- wise yield prediction models are constructed using only variables observable at each decision point, thereby preventing information leakage and ensuring operational consistency. Continuous yield predictions are translated into actionable decisions through quantile-based policies that define high-risk and scrap candidates under fixed capacity constraints. Downstream, Stage 2B and Stage 3 demonstrate how wafer map analysis and SEM-based defect morphology assessment can be organized into operationally meaningful candidate selection and triage records under limited inspection capacity. To ensure claim validity, we introduce a two-layer governance design that separates operational workflow integration from scientifically validated claims. Quantitative performance claims are restricted to the validated core (Stage 0–2A), where same-source ground truth is available, while downstream stages are treated as proxy benchmarks demonstrating functional feasibility without end-to-end causal claims. Experimental results show that incorporating progressively enriched information improves yield prediction accuracy and that the proposed decision agent framework can enrich high-risk wafer selection under fixed inspection budgets. Overall, this work demonstrates that evidence-gated, stag..."

However, design rules between heterogeneous nodes do not scale uniformly: minimum poly width, metal spacing, and well en- closure margins each follow distinct trajectories. This non-uniform scaling can inadvertently alter connectivity during migration. Conventional LVS is designed for within-PDK layout–schematic checking and does not directly support cross- PDK netlist-to-netlist comparison due to model naming and extraction semantic differences. We present a framework for automated standard cell migration from SkyWater 130 nm to FreePDK45, with topology equivalence verification based on graph isomorphism. Our approach models circuit netlists as device-net bipartite graphs and applies the VF2 algorithm to determine structural equivalence. Unlike LVS, VF2 operates on an abstract connectivity graph, enabling PDK-independent com- parison under explicit device-type normalization. It also produces a vertex-level bijection mapping each source device to its migrated counterpart, facilitating sys- tematic debugging. To accommodate the physical source/drain (S/D) symmetry of MOSFETs in the target PDKs, we define an extended isomorphism with relaxed edge-matching conditions permitting S/D interchange. This assumption is specific to symmetric MOSFET models and requires validation for asymmetric devices. The framework comprises KLayout-based netlist extraction, NetworkX-based VF2 checking, and gdstk-based layout generation. We evaluate 42 standard cells spanning 10 gate types; 32 cells (76.2%) pass DRC, LVS, and topology verifica- tion.

Introduction be detected through retrieval-based cross-checking, methodological drift involves structural issues in how claims are framed, scoped, and justified, requiring governance mechanisms that operate at the level of research design rather than factual consistency alone. Existing approaches to AI safety in research contexts have focused primarily on detecting factual inaccuracies and plagiarism. Hallucination detection methods leverage retrieval- augmented generation (RAG) and fact-checking APIs to verify whether generated statements align with known databases or cited sources [4-6]. While effective for identifying contradictions or fabricated references, these tools do not address whether a claim is appropriately scoped (""works in mice"" versus ""works universally""), causally justified (""correlation"" versus ""causation""), or reproducibly specified (sufficient methodological detail for validation). Human expert review remains the gold standard for evaluating methodological rigor, but this approach faces scalability challenges when reviewing AI-generated content at volume and suffers from inter-rater variability in subjective judgments [7, 8]. Ad-hoc keyword filtering (e.g., blocking absolute terms like ""always"" or ""guaranteed"") is brittle and context- insensitive, often flagging legitimate conditional claims while missing sophisticated drift patterns disguised through hedging language. Consequently, there exists a governance gap: no systematic framework currently differentiates between well-qualified AI contributions and problematic generalizations in scientific text generation.

Multi-target strategies addressing neuroinflammation and metabolism are essential. Objective: AI-driven repurposing to identify FDA-approved drugs with dual mecha- nisms targeting neuroinflammation and metabolic dysfunction. Methods: AI-assisted literature mining analyzed 40+ publications (2024-2025). Five candidates emerged: Metformin, SGLT2 inhibitors, Semaglutide, Liraglutide, Pioglita- zone. Multi-dimensional scoring (0-100): efficacy (30%), safety (25%), accessibility (20%), clinical evidence (15%), mechanism (10%). Network analysis mapped drug- pathway-disease relationships. Results: Metformin ranked first (92/100) through exceptional accessibility ($17/month) and safety (30-year record with B12 monitoring). SGLT2 inhibitors second (82/100) via unique ketone production. Pioglitazone third (80/100) with 67% global reach ($33/month) despite heart failure contraindications, surpassing Semaglutide (79/100), which showed strongest clinical evidence (Phase III ongoing) but severe cost barriers ($1,000/month, 24% accessibility). All demonstrated dual anti-inflammatory (TNF-α ↓, IL-1β ↓, IL- 6↓) and pro-metabolic (glucose uptake↑, insulin signaling↑) activities. Network analy- sis: 85% pathway overlap converging on AMPK/insulin/NF-κB, validating multi-target approach. Conclusions: Metformin emerges as optimal first-line candidate for immediate Phase II trials, offering exceptional cost-effectiveness ($67 ROI per $1, $24/month with B12), proven safety, and universal accessibility (100% vs 24% for alternatives). SGLT2 in- hibitors warrant parallel investigation via ketone-mediated neuroprotection. If 30% ef- fective, Metformin could prevent 500,000 annual AD cases globally.

Team ROKAI.,"In modern warfare, AI and drone-centric combat systems have emerged as a key factor distinguishing current military capabilities from the past. However, incidents involving autonomous drone systems are primarily caused by the limitations of computer vision and the high uncertainty of the battlefield environment. To overcome the constraints of data sparsity and real-time processing inherent in combat situations, this paper introduces the concept of 'Reasoning Guard' to drone systems. To implement this, we propose a self-correcting framework that fuses the uncertainty measurement capabilities of Bayesian Inference with the hard sample mining strengths of AdaBoost."

While high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, particularly Large Eddy Simulation (LES), can resolve turbu- lent flow structures with high accuracy, their prohibitive computational cost limits real-time deployment. Existing data-driven surrogate models based on determin- istic regression suffer from spectral bias, producing over-smoothed predictions that attenuate high-frequency turbulent fluctuations. In this work, we propose a conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) framework for reconstructing dense urban velocity fields from extremely sparse sensor measure- ments (5% observation ratio). Our approach incorporates physics-aware design choices including signed distance function (SDF) encoding for building geome- try, interpolation-based input preprocessing, and a residual diffusion formulation that focuses learning on high-frequency corrections. Systematic evaluation on the UrbanTALES dataset across four diverse urban configurations demonstrates Preprint. Under review. that the proposed model achieves R2 scores of 0.546–0.671 for flow speed recon- struction, significantly outperforming deterministic U-Net baselines (0.355–0.540).

This study presents a compact, data-driven framework built on time-resolved unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (URANS) simula- tions for Re ∈{1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 7000, 9000, 11000, 22000}. Two- component velocity snapshots (u, v) are compressed using principal component analysis (PCA), yielding a low-dimensional latent representation with near-lossless reconstruction at L = 50. Using the Re = 22000 dataset, we formulate short- horizon latent forecasting from a finite history window and compare a linear extrapolation baseline with regularized linear predictors; Elastic Net provides the most consistent improvement and approaches the PCA reconstruction bound after decoding. Finally, as an auxiliary analysis, lightweight LLMs are queried as black-box similarity judges between endpoint references, and the entropy of repeated outputs is used as a heuristic uncertainty indicator for regime variation. Together, the results demonstrate an efficient pipeline for latent-space forecasting and a complementary, uncertainty-oriented view of transitional behavior from compressed URANS data. Notably, the LLM-based uncertainty trends consistently interpret the PCA-derived flow representations and provide an effective signal for transition-regime screening across Reynolds numbers."

In this study, we recast biological delivery as a boundary-discovery problem rather than a performance maximization task. We investigate delivery as a function of molecular sequence and context, focusing on identifying the learnability boundary—the regimes where predictive structure exists—and the conditions under which delivery exhibits non- learnable collapse, where prediction fails regardless of model complexity or data volume. We adopt a dry-lab, design-driven methodology using a Minimal Executable Study Design (MESD) that deliberately exposes failure modes. Delivery is decomposed into stage-specific phenotypes (e.g., uptake versus endosomal escape), combined with controlled variation in observable context and intentionally unobserved hidden-state factors. Analysis is governed by pre-specified decision rules to distinguish learnable structure from measurement collapse, hidden-state effects, and non-linear regime transitions.

The AI proposes research questions, alternative hypotheses, and experimental abstractions, while the human researcher critically evaluates, constrains, and ultimately determines the analytical framing and interpretation.

We construct a sequential decision-making environment from large-scale behavioral logs and model user behavior as a mixture of multiple latent RL policies with dynamic switching. By estimating policy-specific parameters and their transition dynamics, the proposed approach identifies distinct decision strategies and their temporal shifts without explicit supervision. Furthermore, we interpret the learned parame- ters—such as reward sensitivity and prediction error dynamics—through the lens of computational neuroscience, linking observed behavioral patterns to theoretical constructs including reward prediction error and strategy arbitration. Experimental results on synthesized behavioral datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively captures strategy heterogeneity and switching behavior, offering an in- terpretable account of decision-making processes beyond pure prediction.

We systematically compare three network topologies—original, scale-free, and small-world—across 50 Monte Carlo replications, and evaluate four node reinforcement strategies including an AI-suggested hybrid combining betweenness centrality, bridge node identification, and load-weighted scoring. Our results reveal: (1) a sharp phase transition in cascade severity at α ≈1.2, below which single-line failures can collapse up to 80% of grid load; (2) small-world networks ex- hibit 35% higher mean survived fraction than the original topology under identical stress conditions; and (3) degree-based reinforcement outperforms other strategies, reducing mean cascade size by 23% compared to no reinforcement. Additionally, N-k contingency analysis reveals nonlinear scaling: k=4 simultaneous failures produce cascade sizes 2.8× larger than k=1. We further demonstrate that an AI-guided real-time mitigation agent, using centrality-aware load shedding during cascade propaga- tion, reduces outcome variance by 35% compared to no intervention, suggesting AI’s greatest value lies in preventing worst-case scenarios.

This study proposes LightWaferSegClassNet, a lightweight multi-task model that simultaneously performs defect segmentation and classification on wafer images while minimizing the number of parameters. Using the MixedWM38 dataset (38 classes, 38,015 samples), we constructed a 2-stage pipeline where a Teacher model (DeepLabV3+ with ResNet101) is first fine-tuned, and then its soft targets (probability distributions) for both classification and segmentation are distilled to train an ultra-lightweight Student model.

To address this, we present Chemical Mechanism Inference AI (CMI-AI), a physically grounded framework based on EXAONE [1] that couples a neural proposal model with a symbolic chemistry core (RDKit [2]) to ensure structural and valence valid- ity. CMI-AI formulates mechanism generation as a constrained tree-search over intermediate molecular states, where each candidate step is executed as an explicit graph edit and validated against deterministic signals including Bond Dissociation Energy (BDE) heuristics, pKa-consistent proton-transfer logic, and intermediate stability indicators. To accommodate the non-linear branching of organic reactions, we employ a Beam Search Algorithm to maintain and rank multiple competing pathways via a hybrid objective function. Furthermore, we introduce the Mask- ing Verification Step (MVS), a diagnostic methodology that masks key causal anchors—such as leaving-group identity and stabilization arguments—to distin- guish authentic chemical understanding from superficial template memorization, using BERT-style masking tests [3]. By integrating online physical constraints with a verification-driven self-correction loop, CMI-AI effectively rectifies systematic pattern-matching errors and provides a highly reliable, interpretable pathway for autonomous chemical discovery."

Con- ventional finite element analysis (FEA), although accurate, is computationally expensive and limits rapid design iteration. We propose a deep learning approach based on a modified U-Net with an auxiliary min–max regression head to predict von Mises stress fields from binary geometry images representing 2D layer-level structures under fixed thermal loading. By jointly predicting the normalized stress field and its physical bounds, the model enables end-to-end stress recovery with- out requiring ground-truth min/max values at inference. The model is trained on 2,180 FEA samples derived from the SkyWater 130 nm process design kit (SKY130 PDK). Among seven systematically evaluated configurations, the best model achieves a mean absolute error of 1.048 ± 1.182 MPa and a maximum stress error of 4.16% on 545 test samples. Ablation studies show that the auxiliary min–max head reduces prediction error by 56% compared to a baseline U-Net, while extended training with gradient clipping improves robustness. The proposed approach reduces inference time by approximately three orders of magnitude rela- tive to FEA, enabling near-real-time stress analysis for semiconductor packaging design."

While AI-driven triage and diagnostic decision-support systems are increasingly proposed to improve efficiency and access, their evaluation typically assumes a homogeneous testing environment, most often reflecting centralized laboratory settings. Here, we present a simulation framework that explicitly formalizes diagnostic decision-making across distinct testing regimes, including centralized testing and point-of-care testing (POCT), by incorporating regime-specific constraints on test availability and capacity. Using synthetic but biologically constrained scenarios derived from curated symptom– disease and test–disease mappings, we evaluate six diagnostic test-selection strategies spanning baseline, clinically motivated, and algorithmic-driven approaches. Diagnostic performance is quantified as the reduction in the number of diseases remaining in the differential diagnosis (ΔD), and regime-dependent effects are assessed using paired nonparametric analyses. We show that strategy performance differs systematically between regimes, that regime dependence is strategy-specific and capacity-dependent, and that identical decision policies can yield qualitatively different outcomes when deployed under constrained testing environments. These findings demonstrate that testing regime is a significant determinant of diagnostic decision-making and highlight the necessity of regime- aware evaluation for the development and deployment of AI-driven diagnostic support systems, particularly as healthcare delivery increasingly shifts toward decentralized and resource-limited settings."

Unlike isolated extreme events, compound events create synergistic impacts that can overwhelm response capacities and multiply damages. This study develops a comprehensive AI-driven framework to detect, predict, and assess the socioeconomic impacts of compound extreme climate events in South Korea. We introduce a novel multi-model architecture combining: (1) Transformer-based temporal pattern detection for identifying sequential compound events, (2) Graph Neural Networks for analyzing spatial propagation patterns, and (3) ensemble learning methods for multi-task impact prediction with uncertainty quantification. Using comprehensive datasets spanning 24 years (2000-2023) from the Korea Meteorological Administration, disaster statistics, and socioeconomic indicators, we identify five distinct compound event types with significant increasing frequency trends (+28%/decade, p<0.001). Our vulnerability index, integrating exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity following the IPCC AR5 framework, reveals significant regional disparities across 30 analyzed regions. The proposed framework achieves F1-score of 0.89 for event detection and R² of 0.82 for impact prediction with 95% confidence intervals. Under CMIP6 SSP5-8.5 scenario, compound event frequency is projected to increase by 112% by 2050. Total annual impacts are estimated at 986.5 billion KRW property damage [95% CI: 823.4-1,149.6], 10,800 health cases, and 737.2 billion KRW agricultural losses."

We conduct a controlled experimental study using the UCI Adult dataset, comparing four minimization strategies defined by the authors with LLM-assisted decision support : a human-designed heuristic baseline and three strategies whose feature- removal order is instantiated with large language model (LLM) decision support and validated by the authors. We evaluate Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting under four progressive minimization levels. Across models, aggressive minimization can trigger a sharp collapse of recall while accuracy remains comparatively stable. At the strictest level, the most aggressive setting reduces recall to near zero (0.0–0.039) with accuracy remaining above 0.74, yielding extreme utility loss (∆F1 down to -0.68). In contrast, the utility-aware Robust strategy shows substantially smaller degradation at the same level (∆F1 between -0.09 and -0.11 across models). These results provide a practical, implementation-light evaluation framework for compliance-oriented feature minimization, and show that the primary cost of minimization can manifest as strategy-dependent recall collapse rather than a uniform accuracy drop."

We evaluate instantaneous accuracy, long-term stability, and domain-specific metrics across four application domains (aerodynamic design, disaster forecasting, cardiac hemodynamics, and wind energy). Results show clear but non-universal performance stratification: projection-based methods deliver interpretability and consistent sta- bility but suffer from hard limits induced by information bottlenecks; direct learning methods achieve state-of-the-art one-step accuracy but exhibit catastrophic error growth over long horizons; recent unified attention-based approaches trade a small amount of one-step accuracy for substantially improved multi-step stability.

Materials and Methods: A retrospective cohort study of 403 men receiving hy- pofractionated salvage RT (62.5 Gy in 25 fractions) from 2017–2024 was conducted. Toxicities, categorized as genitourinary (GU: hematuria, urinary incontinence, fre-quency, dysuria) or gastrointestinal (GI: rectal bleeding, diarrhea, proctitis, nausea), were graded (1–3) using CTCAE-based criteria. Outcomes included any-time incidence, Kaplan–Meier time-to-first-event estimates (12-/24- month cumulative incidence), and first-onset timing. Episode-level analyses merged events ≤30 days apart, assessing resolution and intervention. Results: Median follow-up was 18.2 months. Any-grade GU and GI toxicities occurred in 34.2% and 24.6% of patients, respectively. Specifically, urinary in- continence (20.3%) and rectal bleeding (19.9%) were common. Most toxicities were low-grade; Grade ≥2 incidence was low (e.g., hematuria 4.7%, incontinence 6.0%). Time-to-onset varied: acute events (<3 months) were rare for hematuria (median 17.8 months) but common for frequency/dysuria. Resolution rates for Grade 2 events were high (>65%) with conservative management or medication, though Grade 3 events often required procedural intervention. Conclusion: Hypofractionated salvage RT demonstrates a manageable toxicity profile. Distinct temporal patterns suggest the need for prolonged monitoring for hematuria compared to acute urinary symptoms. ∗Equally contributed. Preprint. Under review."

In particular, bona fide speech processed by neural codecs is frequently misclassified as spoof, leading to critical false rejections in practical scenarios. Despite this emerging challenge, the treatment and labeling of neural- codec-processed speech in deepfake detection remain ambiguous. In this work, we systematically analyze the impact of neural audio codec processing on audio deepfake detection and clarify labeling criteria based on a content-origin definition of bona fide speech. Building on this formulation, we propose a codec-aware training strategy that explicitly models the relationship among clean bona fide speech, codec-processed bona fide speech, and spoof samples. Experimental results across multiple datasets and state-of-the-art detection models demonstrate that the proposed approach substantially improves robustness to neural-codec- processed speech, while preserving reliable performance on clean audio. These findings highlight the importance of codec-aware training for robust and realistic audio deepfake detection."

Rather than producing a single performance ranking, the analysis organizes recurring response tendencies and limitation patterns observed at the task level.

Al- 2 though high-throughput testing has scaled data generation, interpretation remains 3 a manual rate-limiting step, introducing subjective bias and compromising repro- 4 ducibility. To address this, we implement a pragmatic AI-Coscientist framework 5 using a natural-language interface, empowering experimentalists to orchestrate 6 complex analytical pipelines without programming proficiency. Physiscore spans 7 multimodal techniques including photovoltaic, optical, and structural/spectroscopic 8 analysis. The platform bifurcates the workflow into a deterministic computational 9 path and an intelligent reasoning path. By internalizing physical constraints—such 10 as Scherrer analysis in XRD—directly into the algorithms, we enforce rigor that 11 neutralizes the hallucination risks of generative models. The system automates 12 error-prone derivations and data curation, achieving a dramatic increase in ef- 13 ficiency. Experimental validation demonstrates that Physiscore accelerates pro- 14 cessing speeds by up to 131.4-fold (notably in J-V and FE-SEM analysis) and 15 reduces human labor by an average of over 30-fold across all modalities. These 16 outputs are synchronized with OriginLab for instantaneous visualization. This es- 17 tablishes a robust paradigm for materials discovery, refocusing human intelligence 18 on experimental design rather than repetitive processing. 19"

In this work, we propose a Hybrid Quantum-Classical Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoder (HQ-VQVAE) for the unsupervised discovery of degradation patterns from battery cycling data. Our model integrates a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) into the latent bottleneck to promote more expressive representations in a high-dimensional Hilbert space while preserving the discrete interpretability of vector quantization. Without relying on thermal runaway labels, our AI-driven analysis identifies a spe- cific discrete latent code that is repeatedly associated with early-stage degradation signatures, including patterns consistent with voltage drop dynamics and increasing internal resistance behavior. We validate the robustness of this discovered code on the NASA PCoE dataset under cross-cell evaluation, demonstrating stable gener- alization to unseen batteries and improved sensitivity to subtle early degradation dynamics. These results suggest that hybrid quantum-classical representation learn- ing can support interpretable, label-efficient battery health monitoring and enable earlier intervention for safety-critical applications."

Conventional deep reinforcement learning approaches such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) primarily maximize cumulative reward and can behave in a safety-blind manner under noisy clinical trajectories, resulting in critical violations such as hypotension (MAP instability) or abrupt medication changes. CDPO embeds five clinically grounded safety constraints directly into the policy optimization process: MAP maintenance (≥ 65 mmHg), treatment continuity (discouraging abrupt action switches), cumulative toxicity control, fluid restriction when tachycardia is present, and minimum prescription persistence (enforcing a minimum dwell time for selected treatments). To improve training stability, CDPO introduces a damping mechanism that adaptively scales the policy update magnitude according to the observed constraint violation rate, promoting conservative updates when violations increase and allowing larger updates when policies remain within safety limits. Experiments on an adult sepsis cohort from the MIMIC-III database show that, compared with clinician policies, CDPO reduces hypotension-related violations by 22.9% (from 170 to 131 cases) while decreasing vasopressor usage by 67.3%. In addition, CDPO reduces fluid administration by 23.2%, mitigating patient burden while maintaining safety-oriented behavior. Overall, these results indicate that constraint-aware reinforcement learning can derive effective treatment policies that adhere to predefined clinical safety specifications, providing a technical basis for reliable AI-assisted decision support in intensive care settings."

However, exhaustive in vivo screening of ionizable lipid candidates is costly and time-consuming, motivating the development of AI-based models for predicting RNA transfection potency from lipid structure. A major challenge in this setting is the limited availability of in vivo data and the substantial heterogeneity across experimental conditions, which complicates direct aggregation of datasets in the absence of shared reference LNPs. In this work, we investigate condition-based integration of heterogeneous in vivo datasets and demonstrate that datasets sharing the same cargo type, delivered gene, target organ, and administration route can be meaningfully pooled despite differences in LNP composition. Leveraging this strategy, we train AI models that achieve strong within-condition predictive performance, enabling reliable ranking and prioritization of ionizable lipid candidates. Our results provide a practical framework for expanding training data for LNP design under data- limited in vivo settings and highlight both the potential and limitations of AI- driven prediction across heterogeneous experimental conditions."
